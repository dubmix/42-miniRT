# MiniRT

This 42 group project is an introduction to the beautiful and complex world of ✨ **Raytracing** ✨

Raytracing is a widely used rendering technique in computer graphics that can simulate the behavior and reflection of light in a 3D scene, creating realistic images for use in CGI, movies, or video games for instance.

The goal of this project was to reproduce and implement Raytracing algorithms to generate basic 3D images. Each of these computer-rendered images represents a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.
