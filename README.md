# MiniRT

This 42 group project is an introduction to the beautiful and complex world of Raytracing.

Raytracing is a widely used rendering technique in computer graphics that simulates the behavior of light
in a 3D scene, creating realistic images by tracing the path of individual rays towards virtual objects.

The goal of the project is to generate basic 3D images usinf Raytracing algorithms. Those computer-generated
images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by geometric objects,
and each with its own lighting system.
